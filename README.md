TODO:

- configure eslint (https://javascriptplayground.com/typescript-eslint/)

- ~~probably mutations is kind of side effects, should handle via redux-thunk~~

- ~~consider creating redux mutation observer middleware package~~

- ~~remove image preview if node was deleted~~

- improve components render performance (don't rerender twice, etc)
