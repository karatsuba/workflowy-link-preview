## About

This Google Chrome browser extension allows users to preview any URL inside a WorkFlowy bullet node.

The extension fetches provided URL meta tags data (image, title and description) in the background process and embeds it to the WorkFlowy bullet node.

Alongside with URL preview, this extension allows users to preview images and gifs.

## Motivation

First of all, I'm in love with WorkFlowy. It's such powerful and yet simple tool that helps me to organize my whole life.

Pretty often, I found myself missing such preview feature when I'm deciding where to stay during my trip (I like to create a list of hotels and with Link Previewer it's much easier for me to understand what is what).
One more recent case, I was about buying a new camera, so I made a list of cameras I was intended to buy and with Link Previewer it was much simpler to decide which one to choose.

Last, but not least, I always was curious about building a browser extension, hence I got a lot of joy during development.
